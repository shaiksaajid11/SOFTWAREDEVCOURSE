        <h2>Cricket World Cup</h2>
        <p>The ICC Cricket World Cup is the international championship of One Day International (ODI) cricket. 
        The event is organised by the sport's governing body, the International Cricket Council (ICC), 
        every four years, with first qualification rounds leading up to a semifinals and then finals tournament.
         The tournament is one of the world's most viewed sporting events and is considered the "flagship event 
         of the international cricket calendar" by the ICC. The first World Cup was organised in England in 
         June 1975, with the first ODI cricket match having been played only four years earlier. However, 
         a separate Women's Cricket World Cup had been held two years before the first men's tournament, 
         and a tournament involving multiple international teams had been held as early as 1912, when a 
         triangular tournament of Test matches was played between Australia, England and South Africa. The 
         first three World Cups were held in England. From the 1987 tournament onwards, hosting has been shared
          between countries under an unofficial rotation system, with fourteen ICC members having hosted at least
           one match in the tournament.</p>
           <p>
            The World Cup is open to all members of the International Cricket Council (ICC), although the highest-ranking
             teams receive automatic qualification. The remaining teams are determined via the World Cricket League and 
             the ICC World Cup Qualifier. A total of twenty teams have competed in the eleven editions of the tournament,
              with fourteen teams competing in 2015; the recent 2019 tournament only had ten teams. Australia has won the
               tournament five times, India and West Indies twice each, while Pakistan, Sri Lanka and England have won it
                once each.  The best performance by a non-full-member team came when Kenya made the semi-finals of the 2003 tournament.
